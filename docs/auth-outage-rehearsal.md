# Auth-Dependency Outage Rehearsal (TACACS+/RADIUS/LDAP)

A step-by-step chaos scenario for answering one question: **when the auth
server your containers depend on goes dark, what actually happens?**

This doc implements the scenario proposed in
[issue #362](https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba/issues/362). It uses only
pumba's existing `iptables` port-scoped selectors and `netem` commands —
no hand-written iptables rules, no code changes.

## 1. The problem

Containerized workloads routinely depend on remote authentication:

- network automation and device-admin tooling speaking **TACACS+**
- VPN / 802.1X / NAC flows speaking **RADIUS**
- applications and CI runners binding to **LDAP / Active Directory**

Most teams *assume* an auth-server outage degrades gracefully: cached
credentials kick in, a local fallback account works, requests fail fast
with a clear error. In practice, outages reveal surprises:

- the app retries the dead server for 10 minutes before trying the fallback,
- the "local fallback" account was disabled by a provisioning script,
- a service **fails open** (grants access) when it was designed to **fail
  closed**, or vice versa,
- one container's auth library caches aggressively while another's doesn't,
  so behavior differs per workload.

A rehearsal turns these assumptions into evidence. Schedule it before you
need it — ideally before an audit, a migration, or an auth-server upgrade.

## 2. How pumba selects the traffic (read this first)

Pumba's `iptables` command installs rules on the **INPUT chain inside the
target container's network namespace** (`-I INPUT -i <iface> … -j DROP`,
see `pkg/chaos/iptables/loss.go`). That means its selectors match
**inbound** packets. To cut a container off from an auth server, you match
the **auth server's reply traffic** — its source IP and source port — not
your outbound packets:

| You want to match | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| replies from the auth server | `--source <auth-ip>` (CIDR notation) | `--source 10.0.5.10` |
| replies from a service port | `--src-port <port>` (comma-separated) | `--src-port 49` |

Every selector installs **its own rule** (OR semantics): `--source 10.0.5.10
--src-port 49` drops *all* packets from `10.0.5.10` **and** *all* packets
with source port 49, whichever matches first. There is no AND-combination,
so **pass exactly one selector per run** — pick the one whose scope you
accept:

- `--source <auth-ip>` when the auth server has a dedicated IP. It drops
  every reply from that IP, including non-auth traffic, so don't use it
  against an IP that also serves another dependency.
- `--src-port <port>` when the auth IP is unknown or shared. It drops
  replies with that source port from *any* host, so confirm no other
  dependency answers on that port.

The walkthrough below uses `--source` with dedicated auth-server IPs. If
your auth server shares its IP with another dependency, scope the run to
`--limit` test containers or schedule a maintenance window — don't stack
selectors to "narrow" the match, because stacking widens it.

Flag placement matters: `--duration`, `--protocol`, `--source`,
`--destination`, `--src-port`, `--dst-port`, `--interface`, `--limit` all
live on the **`iptables` parent command**; the `loss` subcommand only takes
`--mode`, `--probability`, `--every`, `--packet`. `--duration` is
**required** — pumba refuses to run without it.

### Port reference

| Service | Protocol | Ports | Pumba flags |
|---|---|---|---|
| TACACS+ | TCP | 49 | `--protocol tcp --src-port 49` |
| RADIUS auth / accounting | UDP | 1812, 1813 | `--protocol udp --src-port 1812,1813` |
| LDAP | TCP | 389 | `--protocol tcp --src-port 389` |
| LDAPS | TCP | 636 | `--protocol tcp --src-port 636` |
| Kerberos (AD) | TCP and UDP | 88 | TCP: `--protocol tcp --src-port 88`; UDP: `--protocol udp --src-port 88` |
| kpasswd (AD) | TCP | 464 | `--protocol tcp --src-port 464` |
| Global Catalog (AD) | TCP | 3268 | `--protocol tcp --src-port 3268` |
| Global Catalog SSL (AD) | TCP | 3269 | `--protocol tcp --src-port 3269` |

The walkthrough below uses `--source` only (see the blast-radius note
above); the port selectors in this table are the single-selector
alternative for when the auth IP is unknown.

## 3. Walkthrough: full blackhole

Replace the IPs with your auth servers and `re2:^web-` with your target
containers (names, or `re2:`-prefixed RE2 regexes).

**Step 0 — baseline.** Before breaking anything, record normal auth
behavior: median/p99 login latency, which credential path is used
(remote auth vs cache vs local fallback), and what the logs look like.
You need this to recognize "degraded".

**Step 1 — dry run.** Verify targeting without touching traffic. The dry run
logs the planned targets and selector values — it does not print the exact
per-rule iptables commands, so it cannot hand you the `-D` command for a
rule that survives cleanup (see §6):

```bash
pumba --dry-run iptables --duration 5m --protocol tcp \
  --source 10.0.5.10 \
  loss --probability 1.0 re2:^web-
```

**Step 2 — TACACS+ blackhole.** Drop 100% of TACACS+ replies for 5 minutes:

```bash
pumba iptables --duration 5m --protocol tcp \
  --source 10.0.5.10 \
  loss --probability 1.0 re2:^web-
```

**Step 3 — RADIUS blackhole** (auth + accounting, UDP):

```bash
pumba iptables --duration 5m --protocol udp \
  --source 10.0.5.11 \
  loss --probability 1.0 re2:^vpn-gateway-
```

**Step 4 — LDAP/LDAPS blackhole:**

```bash
pumba iptables --duration 5m --protocol tcp \
  --source 10.0.5.12 \
  loss --probability 1.0 re2:^app-
```

**Step 5 — Active Directory (Kerberos + Global Catalog).** Kerberos uses
both TCP and UDP on port 88, so both protocols must be blocked **at the
same time** — running them back to back leaves one protocol open while the
other is blocked. Launch both variants in the background so their windows
overlap:

```bash
pumba iptables --duration 5m --protocol tcp \
  --source 10.0.5.13 \
  loss --probability 1.0 re2:^app- &

pumba iptables --duration 5m --protocol udp \
  --source 10.0.5.13 \
  loss --probability 1.0 re2:^app- &
wait
```

**Step 6 — partial outage.** A flapping server is nastier than a dead one.
Drop half the replies, or every 3rd packet:

```bash
pumba iptables --duration 5m --protocol tcp \
  --source 10.0.5.10 \
  loss --probability 0.5 re2:^web-
```

During each run, exercise the workload the way users do: log in, rotate a
token, hit the endpoint that re-validates a session. Capture what happens.

## 4. Walkthrough: degraded path (netem)

A blackhole is binary. Real outages are often *slow*: congested links,
overloaded auth servers, cross-region latency spikes. Use `netem` for the
degraded variant. Unlike the doc's first draft, `netem` **does** accept
filters — `--target`, `--egress-port`, and `--ingress-port` — but they match
on the container's **egress** path (the tc qdisc shapes outbound packets),
so plan the topology accordingly:

| Flag | Matches (on egress) | Auth-topology use |
|---|---|---|
| `--target <ip\|CIDR\|container>` | packets **to** that destination (`match ip dst`) | `--target 10.0.5.10` degrades traffic bound for the auth server |
| `--ingress-port <ports>` | outbound packets whose **destination** port matches (`match ip dport`) | `--ingress-port 49` degrades requests headed *to* the TACACS+ port |
| `--egress-port <ports>` | outbound packets whose **source** port matches (`match ip sport`) | the client's source port is ephemeral, so this rarely selects auth traffic — only useful when pumba targets the auth server's own containers (its replies) |

Limitations: inbound replies can't be selected by netem filters — you
degrade the outbound *requests* instead. IPv6 `--target` values are not
supported. Without filters, netem shapes all of the container's traffic, so
prefer a dedicated test instance or accept the wider blast radius.

**Slow auth (2.5s delay + 500ms jitter):**

```bash
pumba --log-level=info netem --duration 5m \
  --tc-image ghcr.io/alexei-led/pumba-debian-nettools \
  delay --time 2500 --jitter 500 re2:^web-
```

Scoped to traffic bound for the TACACS+ server (same effect, narrower
blast radius):

```bash
pumba --log-level=info netem --duration 5m \
  --tc-image ghcr.io/alexei-led/pumba-debian-nettools \
  --target 10.0.5.10 --ingress-port 49 \
  delay --time 2500 --jitter 500 re2:^web-
```

**Flaky auth (50% loss):**

```bash
pumba --log-level=info netem --duration 5m \
  --tc-image ghcr.io/alexei-led/pumba-debian-nettools \
  loss --percent 50 re2:^web-
```

## 5. Observation checklist

For every run, fill in the expected-vs-actual table. "Expected" comes from
your runbook or architecture docs; "actual" from the rehearsal.

| # | Question | Expected | Actual |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Time from first failed auth attempt to fallback engaged | | |
| 2 | Fallback path used (cached creds / local account / secondary server)? | | |
| 3 | Fail-open or fail-closed? (did unauthenticated requests get in?) | | |
| 4 | Auth latency p50/p99 during degradation | | |
| 5 | User-facing error message: clear ("auth server unreachable") or misleading? | | |
| 6 | Retries: bounded with backoff, or unbounded hammering of the dead server? | | |
| 7 | Recovery: after rules are removed, does auth resume without restarts? | | |
| 8 | Alarms: did monitoring fire, and was the alert actionable? | | |

What "good" looks like:

- fallback engages in **seconds, not minutes**, with bounded retries and
  backoff;
- the service **fails closed** (denies access) if that is the design — or
  fails open *only* where that was an explicit, documented decision;
- error messages name the cause ("authentication server unreachable"),
  not a generic 500;
- when the outage ends, the service recovers **without restarts**;
- an actionable alert fired within your SLO.

Anything else is a finding. File it, fix it, re-run the rehearsal.

## 6. Safety notes

- **Stage first.** Run the full rehearsal in a staging environment that
  mirrors production auth topology before touching anything shared.
- **`--dry-run` is free.** It logs the planned targets and selector values
  without touching traffic — use it every time you change selectors. It
  does not print the exact per-rule iptables commands, so it cannot hand
  you the `-D` command for a rule that survived cleanup.
- **`--duration` is your dead-man's switch — but it is not a guarantee.**
  When it elapses (or you abort), pumba issues the mirror `-D` commands to
  remove the rules, and it attempts cleanup on abort too. Cleanup failures
  are logged as warnings only, and if rule installation fails partway
  (e.g. one selector rule was inserted and a later one failed), pumba
  returns without cleaning up. Treat the timer as a safety net, not a
  promise: verify after every run, including ones that errored. Keep
  durations short (minutes) and prefer several short runs over one long
  one.
- **Limit blast radius.** Scope targets tightly (`re2:^staging-web-`,
  not `re2:.*`) and use `--limit` to cap how many matching containers get
  hit. Never run a blackhole against the auth server's own containers —
  that takes the service down for real.
- **Verify cleanup.** After *every* run — including ones that errored —
  confirm the rules are gone inside a target container before the next run:

  ```bash
  docker exec <target-container> iptables -S INPUT
  ```

  The output should match your pre-run baseline (take a snapshot of it
  in Step 0). If a rule survived — e.g. pumba was killed ungracefully or
  installation failed partway — delete it based on what is actually
  present, by mirroring the listed rule into a `-D` command:

  ```bash
  # listed rule:
  #   -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -s 10.0.5.10 -m statistic \
  #     --mode random --probability 1.00 -j DROP
  # is removed with:
  docker exec <target-container> iptables -D INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp \
    -s 10.0.5.10 -m statistic --mode random --probability 1.00 -j DROP
  ```

  (Don't copy a `-D` from `--dry-run` output — the dry run never prints the
  per-rule commands.)
- **Watch the auth server, not just the client.** An outage rehearsal can
  look like an attack from the server's side (connection storms on
  recovery). Coordinate with whoever owns the auth infrastructure.
