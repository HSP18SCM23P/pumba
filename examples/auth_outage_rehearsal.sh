# auth_outage_rehearsal.sh - auth-dependency outage rehearsal runbook.
#
# Mirrors docs/auth-outage-rehearsal.md: blacks out the auth server's reply
# traffic to your containers with pumba's iptables selectors, then runs a
# degraded-path variant with netem delay/loss. No hand-written iptables
# rules needed - --source already exists on the iptables command.
#
# Auth and login checks run WHILE each chaos phase is active: pumba starts
# in the background, you exercise logins during that window, then the phase
# is stopped (pumba removes its rules on stop/abort; SIGTERM triggers the
# abort path). Nothing is exercised after the phase ends - post-phase
# checks can only see the recovered state.
#
# Gating: the script aborts unless the dry run succeeds AND you type an
# explicit 'yes' confirmation. A failed read (stdin exhausted/redirected)
# also aborts - no disruption happens without interactive approval.
#
# All knobs are environment variables:
#
#   AUTH_IP     IP of the auth server (TACACS+/RADIUS/LDAP/AD)
#   AUTH_PROTO  tcp for TACACS+/LDAP/AD, udp for RADIUS        (default: tcp)
#   AUTH_PORTS  comma-separated service ports, for reference    (default: 49)
#               TACACS+ 49 | RADIUS 1812,1813 | LDAP 389,636
#               AD Kerberos 88 | kpasswd 464 | GC 3268,3269
#               Shown in the plan line only: the iptables runs scope with
#               --source alone, because every selector installs its own
#               DROP rule (OR semantics) - stacking --source with
#               --src-port would widen the blast radius, not narrow it.
#               Same for netem: each filter flag installs its own tc
#               filter, so the netem phases use --target alone.
#   TARGET      target containers (name or re2: regex)           (default: re2:^web-)
#   DURATION    how long each chaos phase lasts                   (default: 5m)
#   TC_IMAGE    netem sidecar image                               (default: ghcr.io/alexei-led/pumba-debian-nettools)
#
# Example: rehearse a RADIUS outage against the VPN gateway containers:
#   AUTH_IP=10.0.5.11 AUTH_PROTO=udp AUTH_PORTS=1812,1813 TARGET=re2:^vpn-gateway- ./auth_outage_rehearsal.sh
